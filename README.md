Advanced Project 1 - Comparison between rank-based classifiers and real-valued classifiers

Refernce research article: Rank-basedClassifiersForGeneExpression.pdf
Data: Bremen Big Data Challenge 2019 (https://bbdc.csl.uni-bremen.de/index.php/2019h/28-aufgabenstellung-2019)
Aim: Prediction accuracy of classifiers with rank-transformed data as opposed to real-value data
Support vector machine and random forest classifiers were evaluated for human-activity classification task.

Steps:
1) Rank transformation of data
2) Computing correlation matrix
3) Model building 
4) Accuracy comparison

Results:
